**Task:**  
Firebase misconfiguration is a prevalent internet vulnerability that can expose sensitive proprietary data due to improper security rules. This task involves leveraging this vulnerability to identify potentially affected websites by scanning for misconfigured Firebase databases.

#### Steps:

1. **Understand the Background:**
    
    - Review the blog posts below for context on Firebase vulnerabilities and past discoveries:
        
        - [Chattr Case Study - Blog 1](https://kibty.town/blog/chattr/)
        - [Chattr Case Study - Blog 2](https://mrbruh.com/chattr/)
        - [Firewreck Scanner and Results - Blog 3](https://env.fail/posts/firewreck-1/)
    - Key takeaways include:
        
        - Misconfigurations can allow unauthorized read/write access to sensitive data.
        - Real-world examples show the scope and scale of affected systems, with millions of exposed records.
2. **Implement the Scanner:**
    
    - Build a Firebase misconfiguration scanner as detailed in the last blog post.
    - Use **Go** for implementation, as it has been shown to handle memory and threading issues effectively compared to alternatives like Python.
3. **Perform a Scan:**
    
    - Collect a list of potential target domains (e.g., `.ai` startups, recent tech companies - the configuration file should allow for selection of domain i.e. `.io` or `.dev` etc.).
    - Identify Firebase configurations within the domainsâ€™ JavaScript bundles.
    - Test for access to common Firebase collections or those explicitly referenced.
4. **Analyze and Document Findings:**
    
    - Log results in a structured format, identifying exposed data categories (names, emails, passwords, etc.).
    - Calculate potential impact by estimating data volume and type from accessible collections.
5. **Deliverable:**
    
    - A functioning scanner in Go.
    - A summarized report on identified vulnerabilities, data categories exposed, and estimated impact.

#### Notes:
- Prioritize understanding the implementation details in the provided blog posts to replicate and refine the scanning process effectively.
